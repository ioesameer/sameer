                <div class="details-box">
                    <p>Dynamic soaring is a remarkable technique employed by soaring birds like albatrosses to harness energy from the atmospheric wind gradient and sustain flight without almost flapping their wings. This phenomenon has intrigued researchers across multiple disciplines including biology, physics, applied mathematics, and especially aerospace and control engineering due to the potential of inspiring new technologies that contribute to a more sustainable aviation industry. Significant work has been done in the literature to replicate dynamic soaring using optimal control frameworks. However, these approaches have limitations as they are non-real-time, model-dependent, and computationally expensive. In this project, we develop a categorically-distinguished, autonomous, real-time, and model-free approach for mimicking dynamic soaring utilizing the adaptive control method of Extremum Seeking Control (ESC).</p>

            <h2>Control-affine Extremum Seeking with Attenuating Oscillations</h2>

                <p class="caption">Fig: Multi-agent system with attenuating oscillation</p>
                <div class="details-box">
                    <p>Control-affine Extremum Seeking Control (ESC) systems have been increasingly studied and applied
                         in the last decade. Similar to classic ESC-related structures, control-affine ESC systems are 
                         operable by assuming access to measurements of the objective function, and not necessarily its 
                         expression. In contrast to classic ESC-related structures, in a control-affine ESC, the objective
                          function -- or a map of it -- is incorporated within the system's vector fields themselves. 
                          This has invoked the use of tools from geometric control theory, namely Lie Bracket Systems (LBSs).
                           Said LBSs play a crucial role in the stability and performance characterization of ESCs.
                            In a recent effort, many control-affine ESC structures have been generalized in a unifying class 
                            and analyzed through LBSs. In addition, this generalized class converges asymptotically to the 
                            extremum point; however, the extremum point has to be known a priori, and guaranteeing vanishing 
                            control input at the extremum point requires the application of strong conditions. In this paper,
                             we introduce a LBS-based ESC structure that: (1) does not require the extremum point a priori,
                              (2) its oscillations attenuate structurally via a novel application of a geometric-based Kalman 
                              filter estimating LBSs; and (3) its stability is characterized by a time-dependent (one bound) 
                              condition that is verifiable via simulations and relaxed when compared to the generalized approach
                               mentioned earlier. We provide numerical simulations of three problems to demonstrate the ability
                                of our proposed ESC; these problems cannot be solved with vanishing oscillations using the 
                                above-mentioned generalized approach in literature.</p>

                    <p>In this project, state-of-the-art physical modeling of type-3 DFIG wind turbine systems was 
                        combined with newly developed genetic fuzzy learning algorithms. The goal was to investigate
                         whether training genetic fuzzy systems in a physics-informed simulation environment can enhance
                          wind turbine power generation through improved pitch control. Various wind profiles were applied 
                          to the physical model, and the state space of the differential-algebraic model and wind speed were
                           used as training inputs. This approach identified near-optimal pitch control actions to minimize 
                           overshooting, fluctuations, and stabilization time of the turbine's power output. Results were
                            compared with the industry-standard PID pitch controller, showing very promising outcomes.</p>

                <div class="details-box">
                    <p>In this project, an algorithm to optimally track a non-cooperative quadrotor using a team of 
                        Unmanned Ground Vehicles (UGVs) was developed. These UGVs are equipped with GPS and radar capable
                         of sensing range, azimuth angle, and elevation angle measurements. First, a distributed information
                          filter algorithm was created for each UGV to locally estimate the quadrotor's position and velocity
                           using its data and information from neighboring UGVs. The information from various UGVs was then
                            fused using a Consensus Filter to ensure convergence on the quadrotor's state estimate. 
                            The estimation accuracy of the consensus filter depends on the relative positions of
                             the sensors, necessitating a control policy for optimal UGV configuration to maximize
                              measurement utility. A Model Predictive Controller (MPC) was developed to optimally control 
                              the UGVs, enhancing state estimation. By defining an appropriate cost function and optimization 
                              algorithm in MPC, the UGVs' paths were controlled to improve the accuracy of estimating the
                               quadrotor's position and velocity.</p>

                    <p>Failure of control about an axis leads to an increased rotational path length to achieve the target attitude,
                         as only two of the principal axes can be used. However, this path length can be minimized by choosing the
                          optimal number of submaneuvers. In this project, the optimal number of such subrotations and corresponding
                           rotation angles were derived to minimize the rotational path length. The Global Optimization Toolbox from
                            MATLAB was used to obtain the desired solution.</p>

                         different flight phases such as take-off, climb, cruise, holding, descent, and landing of various airplanes.
                          This tool aids operators and aviation service providers with quick estimations of operational requirements 
                          and performance data. Additionally, it includes optimization methods to estimate the altitude for minimum

                           at an airport. Besides take-off and landing, which are critical flight phases with high parametric
                            requirements, the tool estimates the necessary fuel and flight parameters for climb, cruise, and descent.
                             This supports flight operations engineers in decision-making, managing critical flying situations,
