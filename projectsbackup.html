                    <p>Dynamic soaring is a remarkable technique employed by soaring birds like albatrosses to harness energy from the atmospheric wind gradient and sustain flight without almost flapping their wings. This phenomenon has intrigued researchers across multiple disciplines including biology, physics, applied mathematics, and especially aerospace and control engineering due to the potential of inspiring new technologies that contribute to a more sustainable aviation industry. Significant work has been done in the literature to replicate dynamic soaring using optimal control frameworks. However, these approaches have limitations as they are non-real-time, model-dependent, and computationally expensive. In this project, we develop a categorically-distinguished, autonomous, real-time, and model-free approach for mimicking dynamic soaring utilizing the adaptive control method of Extremum Seeking Control (ESC).</p>

                    <p>Control-affine Extremum Seeking Control (ESC) systems have been increasingly studied and applied in the last decade. Similar to classic ESC-related structures, control-affine ESC systems are operable by assuming access to measurements of the objective function, and not necessarily its expression. In contrast to classic ESC-related structures, in a control-affine ESC, the objective function -- or a map of it -- is incorporated within the system's vector fields themselves. This has invoked the use of tools from geometric control theory, namely Lie Bracket Systems (LBSs). Said LBSs play a crucial role in the stability and performance characterization of ESCs. In a recent effort, many control-affine ESC structures have been generalized in a unifying class and analyzed through LBSs. In addition, this generalized class converges asymptotically to the extremum point; however, the extremum point has to be known a priori, and guaranteeing vanishing control input at the extremum point requires the application of strong conditions. In this paper, we introduce a LBS-based ESC structure that: (1) does not require the extremum point a priori, (2) its oscillations attenuate structurally via a novel application of a geometric-based Kalman filter estimating LBSs; and (3) its stability is characterized by a time-dependent (one bound) condition that is verifiable via simulations and relaxed when compared to the generalized approach mentioned earlier. We provide numerical simulations of three problems to demonstrate the ability of our proposed ESC; these problems cannot be solved with vanishing oscillations using the above-mentioned generalized approach in literature.</p>
